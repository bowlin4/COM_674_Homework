ixw91ag,"This thread is so massive that this probably wont get much discussion, but as a michigan alum, this is huge for me.  For too long this program has played second fiddle, and was a far cry from the era of games like '97 when I got to rush the field after that massive win.  

Last year I think a lot of the national media wrote it off as a fluke, a one-off, plus with the talk of Jim maybe leaving, and it being so long since Michigan has beaten OSU, I don't think it was as big of a win for the school as it should of been.

This year I wanted this one so bad.  I wanted the team to show that was not a fluke last year, that they are back to national prominence, and that there has been a changing of the guard in the Big10.  I think they showed that today.

I've spent the last few seconds in pure disbelief and it just doesn't make sense to me. I've spent the entire regular season watching the Buckeyes play great football it's just not fair.

It's really nice seeing the program pick itself off the mat and beat your rival twice over, especially in the physical manner they did, after a decade plus of suffering (something I can certainly relate to).

As for Ohio St, I wouldn't worry too much. I still have a feeling USC slips up and that opens the door for the #4 spot (maybe I'm being too naive).

ixwduoy,"Respect to Michigan for pulling it off 2 years in a row, in our house.  Nobody can say they didn't earn this; 45-23 erases all shadows of doubt.  My takeaways:

1) CJ is not that guy.  He's a great pocket passer, possibly the best we've ever had, but he freaks out under pressure and can't scramble to save his life.  All the talk about CJ being the best OSU QB ever, \#1 overall Heisman winner, etc. was horseshit.

2) Ryan Day needs to be on the hot seat.  Losing this game twice in a row is inexcusable.  I don't think he needs to be fired yet-- he has at least another year to try and right the ship-- but he certainly is on Strike 2.  I don't want to hear that we went 11-1 and he has a such and such record.  Ryan Day inherited Urban's program, and while his recruiting has been phenomenal, we've been getting worse every year; our record is 1-2 in the only game that matters.  We absolutely lost today because Day (and Knowles) failed to adjust and kept smashing his head against a brick wall, waiting for it to give.  If Day stops trying to prove a point and adjusts at the half, we don't get embarrassed.  Instead, we had **159 stars' worth of recruits** watch us completely collapse.

3) I don't want to make the playoffs after that performance.  In no world do we have a claim to being one of the 4 best teams in the country.  Just send us to the Rose Bowl against the Pac-12's number 2 and let half our players opt out.

Again, I'm not trying to take anything away from Michigan by focusing on what we did wrong; your team executed at a high level and capitalized on our incompetence.  GG no re",KeThrowaweigh,1669500709.0,t3_z5hnxc,z5hnxc,0,30,0,30

I don't know how to fix it, but Ohio State plays with no passion. No killer mentality. On that touchdown, where the quarterback ran it in there was actually a player there who could have made the stop, but instead of coming up and meeting him, he just sat and waited to be hit.

CJ Stroud is amazingly talented but a remarkably uninspiring leader. Actually there are no leaders on this team. Noone is giving speeches, noone is pushing their teammates. If we didn't outclassed all of our opponents in talent I wouldn't choose us to win any close game honestly. 

But the silver lining is this is actually the best outcome for us. Gives us a little bit of fire to take into our bowl game, which hopefully we win and then go into next year still high in the rankings.

ixwxq29,"The base play in my opinion for an entire generation of college offenses using something like 3 wides from the shotgun was the inside zone run, not passing.  This was true for offenses such as Urban Meyer's and Chip Kelly's.  Throw in counter runs and the ability for the quarterback to run the ball, and the success or the failure of the offense comes down to your 6 guys on the line being about to win against 6 of the other team's with one defender schemed out of being in position, and if your 6 guys can win, you can even break big plays running right up the middle.

It seems to me the common theme is something is going on, or something is not going on, with Ohio State's offensive line.  

And that I think if one of Jim Harbaugh's consistent strengths as a college coach, that as long as his offensive line is not completely overwhelmed by future NFL talent on the other side, he will figure out how to get them to play where they can get something going running inside, including breaking the big plays.",jphamlore,1669510170.0,t3_z5hnxc,z5hnxc,0,6,0,6

Chip Trayanum is a really good RB. Ohio State's Dline isn’t able to get pressure. Their secondary doesn’t look impressive. I thought last week was just a bad game. But two weeks in a row is a trend.

I thought UofM could pull away in the second half big because it would be their running game wearing down their defense. Instead it was the opposite, JJ's deep balls in the first half opening up the running game.

I also did not see Ohio State collapsing under pressure like that. I thought if it was close near the end, which this one was, Ohio State would have a huge edge because CJ is a huge asset in close games. Instead, he collapsed and threw 2 INTs.

ixy3byg," What surprised me most, although Ryan Day's galaxy brain play calling are a close second, the beginning of the game. I thought for sure the way the game was going we were gonna see like a 42-21 at half in favor of OSU... unbelievable. To me I do think Michigan is legit after watching that performance. Of course out of spite I hope somehow you miss the playoffs, but if you get there I expect a much better performance than 3 points and possibly a Natty Appearance. Well deserved. GG's

On the other hand... man I can't believe I'm saying this because Urban is a total sleeze ball of a human, but we need him back.  I've been saying since the Oregon game last year, OSU will ALWAYS look impressive against anyone that isn't ranked legitimately in the top 10. That's just how much of a gap there is between us and most of the rest of the country. But for some reason Galaxy Brain Ryan Day just can't help himself. He just HAS to run the ball. Or better yet he wants to make everyone happy. You know even Nick Saban had this problem for a while. Ol' Nicky would love to just run a 4-3 defense and run, and only pass when necessary. But you know what? He missed out on a few Nattys and he saw the way teams were winning with the Air-raid and he decided to get him one of those darn 2 threat QB's. And wouldn't you know it? It worked! He's won 3 Nattys since then! Wow...who would've thunk it? Apparently Jimmy has learned this lesson but not Megamind Ryan Day.

I swear the NFL has this problem too, but I'm really sick and tired of these ""Boy Geniuses"" in football. They're just the worst and they overthink everything. Like the NW game was a perfect example. It's too windy out, it's the storm of the century apparently so we can't throw. Ok then...just run it...oh what we can't do that either apparently? Well I guess we should forfeit then and join the SEC who also can't ""handle the cold weather"" GTF outta here you clowns with your lame ass loser ass excuses! It's NW for God's sake! Just toughen up and run it down their throat!

It's like Ryan Day just hasn't learned how to adjust, or play in big games and, I'm sorry but that's not good enough. He's entering his 5th season next year with a terrible record against Michigan and I believe (it's close) a worse record against TRUE top ten teams. 

It's not good enough. IMO the seat is warm. And if we aren't playing in the CFP next year his seat should be on FIRE!",seracohwris,1669533939.0,t3_z5hnxc,z5hnxc,0,-6,0,-6

There are really no glaring weaknesses here, OSU did everything right on paper and still got blown out. I'd still pick Georgia in the game, but Michigan certainly has a shot and it will be close.

I think you nailed it. Day has all the talent in the world but there's not really a killer instinct. I think that's a byproduct of just being so talented that the team doesn't really have to break a sweat when they're winning 11 in a row. The ND game was kinda close but every subsequent game was a beatdown. So when a Michigan team built around beating Ohio State suddenly starts getting some breaks and capitalizing on Ohio State mistakes, there's this sense of immediate desperation that builds and builds and builds.

IF Ohio State's defensive staff weren't totally inept there could have been you know, a safety back there..but alas they decided that the 1 safety defense which has worked out great the last two years /s was the way to go...again.  It's been frustrating the past couple years as an OSU fan because it legitimately feels like if OSU had an 13-year old with an xbox controller alling the plays based on the Madden ""Coaching Suggestions"" play screen, we'd have done better.   And I mean that not just in the Michigan games. On that trick play today, it boggles my mind that they didn't leave ONE guy back.  I think 10 guys in the box would have stopped a run if that was going to be the play call.  I don't think having that 11th guy was worth leaving the entire backfield open.  But what do I know. Also, it boggles my mind that Ryan Day is calling the offensive plays.  From the field, he's not seeing the full play like the guys in the booth.  When we played Penn State, literally everyone I was with and everyone I was chatting with was like ""the screens aren't working!"" early in the 2nd quarter.  They kept running them.  And then late in the 3rd quarter you hear Joel Klatt on TV saying ""Ohio State needs to get away from these screens, they're not working and the middle of the field is open almost every play"".  What everyone else say early Q2, the OSU coaches didn't see until late Q3.   Mind boggling.  Maybe OSU need to bring Urban on as a consultant or something...Anyway, rant over.

If they keep giving up ~4 yards/carry they trade a fast death for a slow one.  They got to a point where they needed to be aggressive to get the ball back.  

They actually did make some adjustment on the back end to back off their coverage a bit to try and keep pass plays in front of them - there was ~5 yards more cushion on every outside WR in the second half than in the first.  

Then, JJ started hitting underneath routes, OSU backed a safety off, and then started giving up chunk run plays.

Today, I'm not sure exactly what Minter did because the TV view doesn't show the secondary, but my guess is that he mixed in a bit more zone because in the second half our DBs were coming downhill hard on the WR screens and swing passes in a way they weren't in the first half.

ixwhwd2,"It was a one possession game with 7 minutes left... The wheels really fell off, but I think saying they got destroyed misses the reality of the game. The long Michigan rushing TD made OSU basically give up. They looked completely deflated after that and then the desperation interception.

If USC loses and Georgia wins out I'm not sure who would go in over OSU? I don't think any of the non-conference champions would have a chance given 2 losses versus 1 loss. So the only option is probably a two loss conference champ over a 1 loss non-conference champ. So that would be Clemson, Oregon, USC,  and Washington. I don't think any of these would get in over OSU. USC would have a loss against Notre Dame, who OSU beat. Clemson is a team the committee clearly doesn't respect. Oregon is probably the best chance, but I wonder how this would go if Georgia is #1. Is the committee going to set up a rematch between Oregon and Georgia? I think the committee has an easy out and just gives it to the team with only one loss.

So in short, OSU gets destroyed by Georgia if USC loses to Notre Dame. I don't think OSU deserves the chance, but all the other teams have made it pretty hard by getting 2 losses.",timtot23,1669502617.0,t1_ixwb67n,z5hnxc,0,1,0,1

* 13-0 UGA/UM/TCU, 12-1 USC: that's your playoff, in that order.
* 13-0 UM/TCU, 12-1 UGA/USC: 1 UM 2 LSU 3 UGA 4 TCU
* 13-0 UGA/UM/TCU, 11-2 USC: 1 UGA 2 UM 3 TCU 4 OSU
* 13-0 UGA/TCU, 12-1 UM/USC: 1 UGA 2 TCU 3 USC 4 UM
* 13-0 UGA/UM, 12-1 TCU/USC: 1 UGA 2 UM 3 USC 4 OSU

There are probably other possibilities but that's basically it. So really OSU just needs at least one of USC and TCU to drop a game, or if LSU beats Georgia then they need both to drop a game.

We got bailed out a couple times with the ball in the back of the endzone to bell with the PI call and the deep ball into double coverage in the middle of the field... he consistently all year long was overthrowing EVERYONE. I'm not taking away from the fact that he got the job done today and we needed it in a big way, but I don't think he did anything spectacular that Cade couldn't have done.

Then in 2021, Knowles' defense finished top ten in areas such as opponent points per play, opponent points per game, opponent yards per play, opponent yards per game, opponent yards per rush attempt, opponent rushing yards per game, team sack percentage, and sacks per game.

But if I was hired to pick the next coach for yall..... I would pick Joe Brady. Young guy just 33 years old, he turned Burrow who was a transfer into a Heisman winner 1st overall pick. Their whole passing offense he designed and it was unstoppable. Burrow said himself if it wasn't for Brady that national title season never happens and he wouldn't have won a Heisman and got drafted first. Year after he chooses to leave for Carolina Panthers OC job. He got a very raw deal there. Not only did he have dogshit QB's his entire time there, but CMC their main weapon only played 3 games Brady's first year and just 7 games his second. For awhile he had trash Sam Darnold looking like an average NFL qb, didn't take long for him to regress to the player he's always been. With no CMC that offense he had to work with was horrible. Right now he's the bills QB coach but I'm guessing for next year he is hired for a great college HC/OC gig",El-Duque26,1669506137.0,t1_ixwc3h3,z5hnxc,0,2,0,2
ixwnixt,"imo they should give Kevin Wilson a try. His whole Tenure as OC for Oklahoma those offenses were damn good. His offense got Jason White to win a Heisman, a player who never even made a NFL practice squad. His whole time there the only talented QB's he had to work with were Bradford and Landry Jones. Bradford looked good enough to get drafted with the 1st overall pick, then showed his whole career he was dead average. Made Landry Jones look good enough to get drafted 4th round. Then his actual talent in the NFL showed. He was bad, started like 5 games due to injuries of Big Ben. After those first 4 years in the NFL he wasn't good enough to make a team as the backup or 3rd stringer. Career ended when Steelers let him go. Every year Wilson was OC for OU they had one of the top offenses. Adrian Peterson said he was the best play caller he ever had. 

I know every year he was head coach at indiana they only finished around .500 majority of the time. But Indiana never gets the elite talent at every position like OSU does. None of his teams there had anything close to a QB, talent wise that could only make the NFL as a UDFA. None of them were good enough to even just be on a NFL teams practice squad. IU wasn't a school capable of getting an elite/high ranked draft class in any of those years. OSU has top notch recruiters, boosters, a school that always produces many NFL players, great campus, great facility etc. Urban has high standars, if he wasn't good he would've never been made OC in 2017 nor Co-OC in the years after. It was prob a toss up between him and Day when Urban picked the new coach. Doubt it was an easy decision",El-Duque26,1669505261.0,t1_ixwc3h3,z5hnxc,0,1,0,1

ixwbl1q,"It's ultimately debateable.  It's easy to go back and nitpick but the fact of the matter is that when both sides play well, the Offense has the advantage because they have the initiative.  Defense is hard to play.  It's easy for me to say ""stay with the plan of allowing JJ McCarthy to be the one that has to beat you"" with the benefit of hindsight, but when you deal with Plan A and Plan B but are still dying to plan C, it's really hard to account for that when you are already putting all your effort into stopping Plan A and Plan B unless you want to die to Plan A all over again.   

I think it's really on the offensive side of the ball where Ohio State needs to ask questions.  They got away too much from their own run game, and it looks like they stopped being able to hit their own plays down the field.  Hard to read coverage in real time even with the generally solid camera angles Fox gives us, but CJ Stroud stopped being decisive with the ball despite not being under pressure which made it look like he wasn't getting a lot of the looks he was expecting down the field.  

The nice thing about having a credible run threat is you force the defense to prioritize playing the run in particular, and it felt like on defense we were able to get to a place where we didn't need to prioritize it as much. You have to think if they kept running the ball, there's more room for Stroud to keep hitting back.",ituralde_,1669499653.0,t1_ixwa92x,z5hnxc,0,15,0,15

He schemes up some great stuff on offense.

The play calling is usually strong, but when it’s not, it’s *really* bad.  

And despite having all the tools and theoretically the brains to play *very* aggressively on offense, he’s horrifyingly conservative.

He’s got an excellent mind for offense and is definitely a phenomenal offensive coordinator/could probably be a strong head coach at a program where being schematically strong is more valuable.

But if his game management doesn’t *radically* change, he’s only going to win big games by accident.

We’ve played five games against teams with comparable amounts of talent under Day.

We’re 1-4 in those games with only one of the losses being competitive (it was also the one where we had by far the biggest talent advantage).

Michigan was better than we were last year, and while the same may be true this year, it damn sure isn’t as close.

But it doesn’t look like it’s close on the scoreboard which is all that matters.

ixy2c7g,"I mean, if we’re being honest, it should take a blowout loss in the SEC championship for Georgia to fall out of the top 4, shouldn’t it? 

Start with the only teams that can easily pass Georgia:

Michigan and TCU would for sure jump them and USC probably would. USC’s schedule looks tougher on paper so even a narrow Georgia loss should drop them to at least 4 but SEC bias being what it is I could see the committee putting Georgia ahead of USC even with a loss as long as it isn’t a terrible one.

The only other team that can get past them is Ohio State, who did themselves a disservice by getting stomped as hard as they did today. Georgia trounced Oregon in Week 1 and beat a then-#1 Tennessee, which is arguably more impressive than Ohio State’s wins over Penn State and Notre Dame. My guess is a bad loss to LSU leaves Georgia and Ohio State as a toss-up. If Georgia can just keep the game close, I don’t see Ohio State moving up to 4. 

Who’s next? Alabama? No chance to leapfrog Georgia with two losses. Behind them are Tennessee and Penn State. No path for Tennessee. Penn State can’t jump Georgia without Michigan falling past them in the other direction, so a Penn State win doesn’t hurt Georgia’s chances.

There's basically no situation where they get ranked ahead of UM, UGA, or 11-1 OSU at this point so even if LSU drops another game to make Bama the clear top 2-loss team and USC loses one to let Bama jump them, it would be between a 10-2 Bama team and a 12-1 or 13-0 TCU team. Even with a TCU loss in the B12 championship and how shitty the CFP committee is, it would be by far the worst ranking in the history of the CFP to make the semifinals not just 2 SEC/2 B1G but with 2 of those teams having not even played in conference championship games.

But OSU 100% lost to themselves and much as they did to Michigan. We shut them down entirely in the run game in the first half - the points we gave up were on throws that were so poorly defended, any QB could’ve made them.

Second half, different story, Michigan made great adjustments on both sides of the ball. But again, OSU just…didn’t. The defensive scheming was bad. The offensive playcalling was bad. The penalties were silly throughout the whole game. The cornerbacks were tripping over themselves. We handed Michigan that second half on a platter.

Michigan is an elite opponent this year, no doubt. And they played well. But we got blown out with a squad that I still think has some of the most raw talent in the country. I don’t necessarily think firing Day on an impulse is wise, but right now, I think OSU is held back by poor coaching and we could’ve beaten Michigan handily with better coaching on both sides of the ball.

I've met and exchanged good natured ribbing, traded stories with, and generally had a good time with fans from approximately 75 D1 schools, 15 or so FCS teams, 14 teams in the NFL, 22 MLB teams, and 14 European soccer clubs. So my take on OSU fans does not come from a lack of exposure or ignorance on proper fan culture.  
  
ACC: somehow both FSU and Miami fans, who are generally terrible, shit talking people I'd never want to interact with on a daily basis, aren't even in the same trash class as OSU fans, which if you've ever met with Canes or Noles fans on a game day, is actually *in-fucking-credible*. BC (randomly went to a BC/FSU football game, but also in the sweet 16 in basketball vs UF), Virginia, and Louisville fans (both bowl games) were all fine.  
  
B1G: Iowa (3x), Michigan (3x), MSU, PSU (3x), and Maryland all seemed like fine people. Almost all at bowl games.  
  
B12: partied with Oklahoma fans before and after 2008 BCS title game. Everyone was good natured entire time. Putting Nebraska here because the time I met a ton was at 2005 CWS when they were still B12. Also met Baylor fans and a ton of Texas fans there for the CWS title series.  
  
PAC: speaking of the 2005 CWS, come on down ASU and Oregon State, both cool. Utah brought a ton of people to Gainesville this year and they were universally awesome. I can't wait to visit SLC next year. We've got ASU, Cal, and Colorado lined up in football over the next few years so I'll have like half the league soon.  
  
American: Tulane (another CWS, and one of my grandfather's Alma maters) cool. USF cool. East Carolina cool. UCF used to be cool but now like to talk shit.  
Cincinnati, what is it with fucking Ohio people? Talked a ton of shit before 2010 (09 season) Sugar bowl, got destroyed, disappeared. Basically OSU-lite.  
   
Rest of MAC/Sun Belt/MWC/C-USA: never had a bad interaction in like 30 one-off payday football games vs members of these conferences.  
  
Big East: randomly met a bunch of these at basketball or baseball regular season or NCAA tournament pods, all cool. Georgetown, 'Nova, Marquette, DePaul, Seton Hall, Providence, UConn.",optionalmorality,1669538668.0,t1_ixy5du8,z5hnxc,0,1,0,1
